I've created the first plugin that we will start using to replace this pattern -&gt; <https:\/\/github.com\/achambers\/ember-cli-deploy-git-revision-data>\n\nThe idea is that , if you have this installed, it will suck up a bunch of git data and add it to `context.revisionData.git` and you can pull whatever it is you need out.\n\nIf you're interested, you could look at using this instead of the revision-data plugin (caveat, you would still need to use the revision-data plugin if you want to use the file hash for now).\n\nThe repo above uses git-repo-info which does not rely on any git binaries.",
